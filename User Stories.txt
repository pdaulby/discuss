TODO add key to point

as a user i want to be able to 

  make an initial statement
  
  make a counter point (to any point)
  
  accept an opposing point
  
  know who's winning a point in the argument, based on accepted points
  
  unaccept an opposing point 
	must give a counterpoint when doing this
  
  provide evidence in support of a point
  
  explain why the evidence supports the point
  
  request evidence 
	fulfil request

		must give reason/counterpoint when declining
  
  make addition seperate 'initial statements' (alternate discussions)

	decline point linking
		must give reason/counterpoint when declining
		
  mark something as matter of opinion 
	request marking as opinion
		must give opinion to do this
	accept marking as opinion
		must give opinion to do this 
	grey out  lines based on opinion with lack of acceptances
